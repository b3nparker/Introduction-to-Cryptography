    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore a type of attack called *padding oracle attack*. Let's begin by breaking down what padding oracle attack means word by word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding Oracle Attack\n",
    "**Padding**: There are encryption schemes (e.g., a block cipher in the CBC mode) that only support inputs of a fixed length or a multiple of a fixed length. This means it is impossible to use the encryption scheme to encrypt a message $m$ of an arbitrary length directly. Instead, an invertible padding function `pad()` is used so that the padded message $m \\mathbin\\Vert pad(m)$ has the target fixed length or a multiple of the fixed length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Oracle**: In a padding oracle attack. The oracle is typically a remote server that knows the decryption key. The attacker will ask the server to decrypt specially crafted messages, and the server will try to decrypt the messages and tell the attacker if the decryption succeeds or not. For encryption schemes with padding, a part of the decryption process is to check whether the padding is valid. If the server leaks whether the padding is valid to the attacker explicitly, then we say that the server is a *padding oracle*. (This is in contrast to sending the attacker a generic \"decryption failure\" message regardless of the type of failure that occured during decryption.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attack**: The attacker uses the padding oracle to break the confidentiality of the encryption scheme. Typically, a padding oracle attack aims to recover the plaintext of a given ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "In this programming assignment, your goal is to implement a padding oracle attack against AES-CBC with a specific padding function. The attack allows an attacker to recover the plaintext of the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The assignment is broken down into three components. \n",
    "In the first component, your goal is to implement AES-CBC with the said padding function. You are given an implementation of AES and you only need to implement the CBC mode and the padding function.\n",
    "In the second component, you need to implement the core of the padding oracle attack: an attack that recovers one byte of the plaintext.\n",
    "In the last component, you will extend the attack in the second component to recover the whole plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first component is worth 20 points, the second component is worth 50 points, and the last component is worth 30 points. The whole assignment is worth 100 points. Usual rules regarding acedemic integrity apply."

    "### Remarks\n",
    "1. You have seen in the lectures that AES-CBC is a CPA-secure cipher. So why it is still possible for an attacker to break its confidentiality? What capability have we allowed the attacker that is not a part of the CPA security game? Try to formulate a new security game that captures the new capability. (We will see this formally in the lectures later.)\n",
    "2. The attack you have implemented allows an attacker to recover the plaintext of a ciphertext, but it does not allow you to recover the decryption key. This is not a glitch in the security definition and it is very normal in attacks.\n",
    "3. You may think that adding integrity protection (by using a MAC) is sufficient to prevent this attack. It turns out that this is not always the case. In particular, SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 (roughly speaking, TLS is a rebrand of SSL) pack a message $m$ as $m \\mathbin\\Vert MAC(K_{MAC}, m) \\mathbin\\Vert pad(m \\mathbin\\Vert MAC(K_{MAC}, m))$ before encryption. During decryption, the validity of the padding is checked *before* the validity of the MAC, and the \"invalid padding\" message is sent to the client explicitly. So nothing is stopping the attack you have implemented from working! For more padding oracle attacks on the CBC mode, see the following paper: [Serge Vaudenay. Security Flaws Induced by CBC Padding Applications to SSL, IPSEC, WTLS...](https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2002/23320530/cbc02_e02d.pdf).\n",
    "4. The reason why the key is referred to as the decryption key in this assignment is that there are also padding oracle attacks on public-key encryption schemes (where the encryption key and decryption key are different). You will see an example of a padding oracle attack on a public-key encryption scheme in a later assignment."
